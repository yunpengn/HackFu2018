## The Era of Airship

It is the dawn of a new age of global connectedness. Airship routes have made the world smaller, reducing voyages of many months to flights of only a few days. However, the dangers of long-distance travel remain – _especially the danger of pirates_. Bands of fearless opportunists resembling the pirates of old have taken to the skies in their own airships, terrorising and plundering passenger and cargo vessels alike – or so the stories go.

But you never thought you would encounter any actual airship pirates. Until it happened on your first transatlantic flight. Worse yet, this crew of pirates appear to have a strong interest in a certain document in your possession and need you to translate it. Only thing is, _you don't know how_. You'll need to stall for time and gain their confidence in order to avoid being made to walk the plank. And who knows: **solve the challenges that come your way, and you may end up with a share of the treasure**...

## And You

You watch the clouds slowly drift by your window. But by now, fascination at their closeness has given way to interminable boredom. You are thoroughly sick of flying. Though your journey is already more than half over and only on its third day -- you booked passage on the fastest transatlantic airship you could find -- you find yourself wishing it would be done sooner. You miss the sight of the ground and the feeling of not being bored out of your skull.

Turning away from the window, you cast a desultory gaze across the cabin. The passengers are the same people they were yesterday and the day before that. Some are reading, some are watching the in-flight cinevision, and some, like you, are twiddling their thumbs, in a state of advanced boredom.

There's nothing good on the cinevision, and the only book you have on hand is your grandfather's deadly dull academic thesis, useful only as a sleeping aid. If only you'd brought something to do.

## They Came ...

As if in cosmic answer to your wish for stimulation, the entire cabin shakes. Your face is thrown against the window.

Before the pilot can make an announcement about turbulence over the intercom, a door across the way and in front of where you're sitting explodes open, smacking into the opposite wall with a THUNK! Wind whips up around you as air escapes the cabin.

A wooden board lands on the open edge, and there is a sound of boots stepping across it. A silver-haired woman wearing a three-corner hat strides into the cabin and stands in the middle and points an ornate pistol down the aisle.

"Passengers of the Triumph, you have been boarded. My crew will be coming around to all of you with some bags. Please produce all of your valuables and place them in the bag, and we will not need to make this simple business transaction messy. Do not try to be a hero."

Lacking any means to defend yourself, you decide the wisest course of action is to comply with the pirate's demands. You've heard of this sort of thing happening, but you didn't think it would happen to you on your first airship flight. If you're lucky, the rest of this pirate crew will be as businesslike as their captain and won't make anyone walk the plank.

You fish your few valuables out of their carrybag and place them on your lap. Shortly, a deeply tanned, wiry man with a scar across his left eye shoves a smelly leather bag in your face. You dump everything in, smiling and nodding at the man as you do. He doesn't smile back, but eyes your ratty carrybag.

"Lemme see in t'bag," he spits.

Still smiling, you hand him your bag. He roots around inside it for a few seconds, and then goes still. His eyes widen, and he yells, "Cap'n, Cap'n, come 'ere!"

The captain strides over. "What is it, Smelly Pete?"

## The Parchment

With shaking hands, Smelly Pete lifts a ratty old piece of parchment from your bag. You recognise it as having been slotted into your grandfather's very boring book. The pirate captain also appears to recognise it. She snatches it from Smelly Pete and holds it up to her face.

The pirate captain squints at the parchment, and her expression slowly turns from elation to perplexity. She looks up from the parchment and at you. You avert your eyes from her piercing gaze.

The captain mutters something to Stinky Pete, and at once you feel a rough hand grasp your upper arm. "Take the bag," Pete orders you, and you grab your ratty rucksack before you're forced out of your seat.

By now, the pirate crew has collected up everyone's valuables and is all clustered in the middle of the aisle around you, the captain and Smelly Pete. The captain looks to her crew, shouts something in a language unfamiliar to you, and walks to where the broken door has been jammed back into place. The crew braces themselves for the wind while two crewmembers pull it open, and then proceeds across the plank. Smelly Pete and another pirate drag you along, jeering and threatening as they do.

## It Began Now ...

You notice that no-one else on the airship has been forced to leave their seats, and you venture to ask Smelly Pete what it is they want with you.

Pete points to the captain, who's still clutching your parchment. "Cap'n's finally found the last piece of the map, but she can't read it. Was yours, so yer going to translate."

As Pete says this, the three of you step out of the airship and onto the narrow, rickety crossing plank. You look down and instantly regret it. But the view does give you a good incentive not to blurt out to the pirates that you have absolutely no idea how to translate whatever it was they found in your grandfather's book.
