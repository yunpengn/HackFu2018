After some time, the pitch darkness in the inner sanctum at the top of the Atlantean tower doesn't seem quite so pitch. Shades of colour disrupt the blackness, forming abstract shapes before your eyes. You're not sure whether you're awake or dreaming.

After an eternity of floating in the blackness, watching the shapes and colours come and go, a more concrete form resolves before you eyes. It is a simple wooden door. As you stare at the door, you become aware of its plain bronze knob, and the keyhole beneath the knob. At the same time, you feel your body again. You look down at your hands, your feet. You walk towards the door.

A voice calls out, muffled from behind the door. "Welcome to our inner sanctum," it says. "We have waited, slumbering, for the forces of destiny to bring about this moment. Now you are here. But the work is not yet done. You must place the final key in the final door. Only then shall the people of Atlantis awaken."

Realisation crashes down on you like a lead weight. You see yourself, your family, your ancestors, your long, long past. You see your grandfather, working on his thesis, slipping the small piece of weathered parchment between the covers. You see a line of men and women, going back, back to this very place.

You have returned home after a long journey, and stand now at the threshold of your family's true home. Will you enter?
