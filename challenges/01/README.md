## Background

The pirates' dirigible is smaller and nimbler than the passenger craft you just left. Its rich, dark wood gondola is suspended by ropes some way from the bottom of its large envelope of black fabric. If there was just a skull-and-cross-bones logo emblazoned on the side of envelope, it would look just like an illustration in a child's adventure storybook.

You don't have much time to admire the craft though, as you're swiftly led across the rickety plank and immediately down a dark hallway. Before your eyes have time to adjust to the interior, you're tossed into a small room, the door swiftly slamming and clicking locked behind you.

"We'll come for yer translatin' later," the muffled voice of Smelly Pete yells. You hear the stomping of heavy, booted feet moving away, and then silence.

Your eyes eventually adjust to the darkness, but there's not much to see. The small, windowless room is equipped with a bed and little else. You sit on the bed and stare at the featureless wood-panelled wall for long enough for your eyes to grow heavy with sleep. The bed is hard and uncomfortable, but you manage to fall asleep.

~ยง~

You're suddenly awoken by a loud crashing noise and the sound of vigorous swearing. Adrenaline spikes through your body and you spring upright in bed. 

The previously pitch-dark room is illuminated. You squint and blink in the bright light. As your eyes adjust and you see the source of the light, you let out a gasp.

Carved into the wooden wall in front of your bed, in elegant cursive, is a poem. It takes up most of the wall, reaching almost from ceiling to floor. The letters glow bright yellow, but the quality of the light is strange to you -- it resembles neither a flickering flame nor a steady electric light. The light seems almost to pulse, as if it were alive.

You read the strange glowing poem.

	The house is a room.
	"They say nobody ever gets out
	No light can pierce its gloom
	Can't know what it's all about"
	
	The entrance is a door.
	"boarded shut for years."
	The exit is in the floor.
	"though it seldom appears."
	
	The field is southwest of the house.
	The house is west of the entrance.
	The angry dog is inside the house.
	"He values his independence."
	
	The entrance is west of the stream.
	West of the field is the pit of hell.
	A room can be a nightmare or a dream.
	"Especially if it's under a spell."
	
	The answers you seek are here.
	In the stanzas above is a map.
	"From east to west shall it appear.
	Zoom out to avoid the trap."
	
Right beneath the poem, in contrastingly rough-hewn and non-glowing letters, is a set of words with large spaces between them. It reads:
	
	hackfufirst      second      third      fourth      end

Feeling perplexed, you step out of bed, intending to get a closer look at the wall. As you put your foot down, a sharp pain shoots through the your sole. You instantly jerk your now-bleeding foot up and cradle it in your hands.

You appear to have stepped on a carving knife lying on the floor next to your bed. That definitely wasn't there yesterday.

After binding up your foot with a bit of fabric torn off the bed's duvet, you pick up the carving knife and turn it over in your hands. It's sharp and appears brand new. You glance at the glowing poem and the cryptic line carved beneath it, and then back at the knife. You're getting the beginnings of a very weird idea.
