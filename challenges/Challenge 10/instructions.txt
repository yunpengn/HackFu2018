You follow the strange beam of twisting light that was the frog into the tower and up through the twists of a spiral staircase, higher and higher. It's a cramped, claustrophobic space. When you and the pirate crew finally reach the top, you come out into a large open space under a dome. You are near the very top of the tower.

Rather than a floor, the open space has four narrow bridges that meet at a solid mass of stone in the very middle of the tower. From the dim light of the pirate crew's lanterns, you can make out a set of symbols on the stone wall closest to where you just came out. You take a lantern from the nearest pirate and step forward onto the narrow bridge.

Slowly, carefully, you walk towards the stone mass at the centre of the room. You focus on the symbols on the wall. You don't look down.

After what feels like a lifetime, you reach the wall, and collapse against it. A cheer rises from the pirate crew, but it seems small and hollow in the vast and sombre space -- a space which, to the best of your knowledge, no other living beings have entered in five thousand years.

When you've recovered your wits from the harrowing walk across the bridge, you examine the symbols on the wall. They appear to have changed slightly since you first saw them, into familiar mathematical notation. Like the apparition you encountered in the garden, with its English text, this engraving has magically made itself comprehensible to you. The symbols glow with a familiar yellow light, like the frog's eyes, or the poem on the wall of your prison cell so long ago.

It's time to do some mathematics.
