The noise is sudden and deafening. You clutch your ears, desperately trying to block it out, and see the pirates around you doing the same.

"We're under attack!" shouts Captain Hartford.

Her snap judgement, while understandable under the circumstances, turns out to be false. There are no other airships anywhere in sight, nor any warships in the ocean below. There aren't any stowaways on board, and this is not the beginning of a mutiny.

What has happened is this: Every wireless set on the Hurricane has, as if by the frog's command, begun to blare the same piercing transmission. The cacophony of harsh static is unbearable -- it permeates every corner of the ship. If it continues much longer, your ears will start to bleed, or at least it feels that way.

"Turn it off!" screams Captain Hartford.

You are in full agreement -- well, almost. "Not all of it!" you add. "Bring me one of the wireless sets, turned down."

Your old prison cell -- the place the frog led you after completing the previous challenge -- now becomes an impromptu workspace. Papers and pens are brought in, and a desk is set up for you in the middle of the room. Gradually, the noise around the ship recedes, and you can hear yourself think again. Finally, the noise stops.

A large wireless set with a bewildering array of knobs and dials is brought in and set on the desk in front of you. You can hear the noise coming from it, very faintly. You affect a look of curiosity and start fiddling with one of the dials, mostly for show.

The pirates look to you expectantly.
