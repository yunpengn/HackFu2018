Back on the Hurricane, you look over the strange parchment from the frog's mouth. It contains progressively longer lists of seemingly random numbers. Some meaning is hidden here, but you're uncertain exactly what it could be.

You keep the message from Admiral Kilroy to yourself, along with the enchanted bell. While you feel a certain loyalty to the pirate crew, you're not sure it isn't just Stockholm Syndrome. After all, they did kidnap you and force you to complete logic puzzles under pain of death.

After thinking the situation over, you hit upon an idea. With Hartford's help, you make copies of the parchment and hand them out to the pirates, whom you arrange into groups. Desks and chairs are brought to the largest open area of the Hurricane -- the bridge -- and the pirates cluster around them. The whole scene closely resembles an adult nightschool classroom, if one was held on the bridge of an airship.

You give different orders to each of the pirate groups, and the crew sets to work deciphering the frog's strange message. Any grumbling or complaints are swiftly shut down by an exhortation from Captain Hartford, "Remember the treasure!"

The bronze frog sits in the middle of the room, awaiting the next words of power.
